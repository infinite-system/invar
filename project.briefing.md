# Overnight briefing — started 2026-07-29 00:28

## RESUME ANCHOR 21 — 2026-07-31 ~02:0x (written at the 86% CHECKPOINT; supersedes anchor 20)

### OPERATIVE STATE

ACTIVE USER GOAL (a session Stop hook enforces it): the FIELD V2
PROGRAM — make the Invariant Field app look awesome, game-like,
reimagined; 3D version; code lenses with TS/Vue syntax highlighting
(the Field as a door into the implementation); Vue SFC script setup
lang ts; strict project.conventions.md same as the app; timeline
playout. 5 tasks, max 3 builders concurrent, Opus-5-MEDIUM synthesis
capstone. USER: v2 is built on a CLONE (tools/invariant-field-v2/);
v1 (tools/invariant-field/) stays byte-untouched.

THE PIPELINE (task folders + briefs all committed):
- #415 foundation — LANDED c25b135f (v2 clone, Vue SFC + ivue,
  Bun.build+compiler-sfc, tokens seam; v1 untouched, ports 4313/4314).
- #416 design language — LANDED ff82192e (spec+tokens+mockup at
  tools/invariant-field-v2-design/; mockup is the visual north star).
- #417 3D field + timeline playout — DISPATCHED (codex sol HIGH),
  brief in folder; owns FieldView/camera/3D/playout, seam = selection
  state on InvariantFieldApp.
- #418 code-lens explorer — DISPATCHED (codex sol HIGH), parallel;
  owns cards/lenses/list + read-only path-confined span endpoint;
  keeps out of FieldView.
- #419 Opus synthesis (claude opus MEDIUM, user explicit) — last;
  integrates all into the "Invariable representation instrument".
  USER ADDITIONS (recorded verbatim in the #419 task file): a simple
  release GATE (tests + driven smoke confirming the formula); the
  instrument's OWN invariant-field.invariants.md + .lattice.md
  (found vs chosen, interactions); SELF-MEASUREMENT — its contract
  enters the scan so the Field shows its own dots and evolution,
  surfaced beautifully.
Wave sequencing: land 415+416 -> write briefs 417+418 from their
reports -> dispatch both -> land -> write 419 brief -> dispatch ->
land. Landing ritual unchanged (extract-gate-verdict.sh, overlap
check, land.sh with GATE_LOG).

LANDED THIS SESSION: #393 idle CPU (79b325ea, painted-priced
dashboard); #413 Invariant Field v1 (df9419cc, 77m — 377 records,
axiom-mapped 11-component rank, ivue UI, calibration by planted rot).
V1 runs: bun tools/invariant-field/server.ts --host=0.0.0.0 (port
4313; --host flag committed; user views from macOS host at
http://10.211.55.7:4313/). A field server may still be running.

FILED: #414 citation-drift pair (#413 bycatch; fixing it moves two
dots inward). #412 monitoring LSP CPU rows (queued). The pre-goal
review-pause was superseded by the user's Field v2 goal.

### MECHANICS HARDENED TODAY (all committed, self-tested)

- steer.sh: landing PROVEN at the builder's own session record
  (rollout/claude store); steers.log records ONLY confirmed landings;
  pending markers -> fleet-watch confirms or raises STEER_LOST (15m).
  Fragment = longest punctuation-free run (em-dash/period defeats
  found live). Composer occupancy = normalized region after last
  prompt + queue-hint. If a steer reports QUEUED mid-turn that is
  normal.
- steer.sh AUTO-RESTORES dead in-progress lanes (relaunch.sh: codex
  resume --last / claude --continue); closed lanes need STEER_REVIVE=1.
  Never hand-relaunch bare (plants @ready/@busy markers land.sh needs).
- relaunch.sh: resume-in-conversation relauncher, meta.json-driven.
- Doctrine for all of this is IN the conductor skill (Liveness section).

### WATCHERS

fleet-watch Monitor: `Monitor(command: bash scripts/fleet/fleet-watch.sh, persistent: true)` — re-arm if TaskList shows none.
Crons: RE-ARMED by user 2026-07-31 ~02:2x ("The 2 crons loaded?") — the pair per the conductor skill: hourly orchestration :07 + reconciliation sweep :37. This supersedes the 740c5d81 disarm. Re-arm both on restart.

### USER CONTEXT

User on macOS host, VM is 10.211.55.7. Codex effort floor HIGH
(dc24997d) for creative work; opus synthesis MEDIUM (explicit). Open
offer (untouched): flip user's ~/.codex/config.toml to medium.
Known open bugs the user mentioned but has NOT yet detailed: "I see
some bugs, but will get back to it soon" — expect reports later.

## NORTH STAR (user, 2026-07-29 12:4x, verbatim intent — long-term direction)

Beyond VS Code parity: **InvarOS** — an AI-powered system that codes WITH
you and runs fleets on ANY codebase: prepare a repo with its own merge
gate + contracts + task ledger, deliver at fleet rate under invariants.
Terminal-native is the moat: tmux/ssh/cron/processes/PTYs are first-class
controllable and monitorable surfaces VS Code's sandbox cannot reach. The
fleet discipline stack (dispatch/land/gate/watch/round-brief/link-lint)
is deliberately PORTABLE — it is the product; the editor is the cockpit.
(Related: the capsule/populate-a-repo skill remains HELD by the user until
architecture refinement — do not start it unprompted.)


## NORTH STAR ADDITION (user, 2026-07-29 ~21:5x, verbatim)

> imagine we create our own internet between Invar instances

Named by the user 2026-07-29 (verbatim): "Indranet Invarnet" — Indra's
net. Follow-on exploration filed as #327 (p2p streaming underlay,
capped transfer allocation, server independence), his words verbatim
in the record.

Conductor reduction (for seam decisions, not yet tasks): presence
(discovery) -> shared state (ledger/records sync across instances) ->
live surfaces (panes projected between instances; panel content-set
machinery is the seam) -> fleet mesh (cross-machine dispatch).
Standing implication: prefer seams that keep panel content sets,
task records, and plugins location-independent.

## SUPERSEDED ANCHORS 1-19 PRUNED 2026-07-30 (user-approved cleanup; git history holds them — anchors 1-7 pruned 2026-07-29 20:3x, anchors 8-19 + overnight sections pruned 2026-07-30)
